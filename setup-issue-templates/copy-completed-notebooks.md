Add completed notebooks to the `completed-notebooks` directory by manually running the GitHub Action `copy-completed-notebooks.yml`.
This action requires two input arguments that you will be prompted to provide:

- Which training module is being taught
- The [`training-modules` repository](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/training-modules) tag from which notebooks should be copied

_Optional_: You can also remove the `.gitkeep` file from `completed-notebooks`.
