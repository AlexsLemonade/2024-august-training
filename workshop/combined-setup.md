title: Workshop setup instructions
---

This will be a hands-on workshop, so to maximize our time, please arrive having installed and set up the software that we will be using.
We will _not_ have time to do all of the setup during the workshop and accomplish all of our goals for the workshop, so it's important to take the time to do this before the workshop begins!

Please to set aside ~2 hours to perform all setup tasks:


* Please install Slack, which [we use to communicate with you](../software-setup/slack-procedures.md) before, during, and after the workshop.
  * [Instructions for setting up Slack](setup-instructions//slack-setup.md)
* For roughly half of the workshop, you will work locally on your laptops.
For this, you will need to install and setup several pieces of software, including R, RStudio, several R packages, GitKraken, and a suitable text editor.
Please find instructions for your computer's operating system at the appropriate link below:
  * [macOS local software installation instructions](setup-instructions/mac_installation_instructions.md)
  * [Windows local software installation instructions](setup-instructions/windows_installation_instructions.md)
* For the other half of the workshop, we will use our RStudio Server rather than having you work locally.
  * Once you have been given your RStudio Server username and temporary password, follow [these instructions](../software-setup/rstudio-login.md) to log in to our RStudio server and change your password.
* You will need to create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account if you do not already have one and configure the GitKraken application, installed in the step above.
  * [GitHub and GitKraken setup instructions](setup-instructions/github_gitkraken_setup_instructions.md)
