## Pre-workshop Prep

* Please review the [Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct.md).
* If you are new to using R, we've [assembled some resources for getting starting with R](../additional-resources/R-resources.md#pre-workshop-prep-for-r-programming) that can optionally help prepare you for the workshop.

### Setup instructions

This will be a hands-on workshop, so to maximize our time, please arrive having installed and set up the software that we will be using.
We will _not_ have time to do all of the setup during the workshop and accomplish all of our goals for the workshop, so it's important to take the time to do this before the workshop begins!

**Please to set aside ~2 hours to perform all setup tasks:**


* Please [follow these instructions to install and set up Slack](setup-instructions//slack-setup.md)
  * [We use Slack to communicate with you](../software-setup/slack-procedures.md) before, during, and after the workshop.
* For roughly half of the workshop, you will work locally on your laptops.
For this, you will need to install and setup several pieces of software, including R, RStudio, several R packages, GitKraken, and a suitable text editor.
Please find instructions for your computer's operating system at the appropriate link below:
  * [macOS local software installation instructions](setup-instructions/mac_installation_instructions.md)
  * [Windows local software installation instructions](setup-instructions/windows_installation_instructions.md)
* For the other half of the workshop, we will use our RStudio Server rather than having you work locally.
  * Once you have been given your RStudio Server username and temporary password, follow [these instructions](../software-setup/rstudio-login.md) to log in to our RStudio server and change your password.
* You will need to create a [GitHub](https://github.com) account if you do not already have one and configure the GitKraken application, installed in the step above.
  * [GitHub and GitKraken setup instructions](setup-instructions/github_gitkraken_setup_instructions.md)
* If you do not already use a password manager (for example, [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com) or [1Password](https://1password.com/)), we strongly recommend signing up and setting it up for general use.
  * During this workshop, you will need to keep track of sensitive passwords, and using a robust password management system is the most secure way to do so.
