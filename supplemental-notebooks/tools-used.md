# Tools used during the workshop

| Tool | What is it? | When do we use it? | Additional notes |
|------|:------------|:-------------------|:-----------------|
| Terminal | An interface to the bash or zsh programming languages  | To interact with command line programs, including UNIX commands like `pwd` | Where we run command line (i.e., not R) tools like Salmon |
| RStudio | Integrated Development Environment (IDE), typically on your local computer | - Interactive sessions using the R programming language <br> - Developing in RMarkdown <br> | - Can be used just like a text editor to edit shell script <br> - Can be used to interact with the Terminal |
| RStudio Server | Integrated Development Environment (IDE), but it supports multiple users | Same as local RStudio | In this course, it allows you to access the Terminal on our server without additional setup |
| Visual Studio Code | Integrated Development Environment (IDE) supporting many languages | Writing code in many different programming languages | |
| Git | Version control system | To track our code and small, non-sensitive data files | Can be used via the command line (i.e., Terminal) or something like GitKraken |
| GitKraken | Graphical user interface (GUI) for using Git | As a more user-friendly way to use Git to track code written in other applications | |
